            <h3>Spain:</h3>
            <p id="mainP">"Spain's biggest airport is in Madrid, making it the most likely
                arrival point for most visitors to the country."<br>
                Madrid is the city where I stayed at and I completely fell in love with it !<br>
                From it's variation of delightful food to very friendly people.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Places I visited :</li>
                    <p> 1. Royal Palace of Madrid , is the official residence of the Spanish Royal Family
                        , although now only used for state ceremonies.<br>
                        2. Plaza Mayor , is a major public space in the heart of Madrid.<br>
                        The Plaza Mayor , is for the people of Madrid and tourists to shop,
                        walk around, eat, and enjoy the outdoors.<br>
                        3. Gran Vía , referred to as the "Spanish Broadway", is one of the city's most important
                        shopping
                        areas, with a large number of hotels.<br>
                        4. Outside Madrid , I visited the city of Toledo , located in central Spain.<br>
                        Is known as the "Imperial City" and as the "City of the Three Cultures" for the
                        cultural influences of Christians, Muslims and Jews reflected in its history.

                    <li>Transport: </li>
                    <p>"The Madrid Metro system is the 12th longest rapid transit system in the world"<br>
                        This was the best , fastest and efficient way to travel around Madrid.<br>
                        The price is reasonable and they also provide
                        with a 10 pre-paid ticekts for $20 wich was really convenient.

                    <li>Food:</li>
                    <p>Madrid has a variety of regional and international cuisines that is unparalleled anywhere
                        else in Spain.<br>
                        I have to say that the food was delightful with great quality for the cheap price.<br>
                        <br>
                        The must-try typical food :<br>
                        <br>
                        1. Callos a la Madrileña ; is one of the typical foods during the winter.<br>
                        You’ll normal find this stew in a clay dish. It features strips of beef tripe (stomach),
                        chunks of chorizo and slices of morcilla (blood sausage).<br>
                        2. Bocadillo de Calamares ; No trip to Madrid is complete without
                        tasting the city’s most famous sandwich: the bocadillo de calamares, or fried squid
                        sandwich.<br>
                        It consists of crusty, fresh bread loaded with flour-coated, deep-fried rings of squid, and
                        nothing else.<br>
                        Some Spaniards top the two-ingredient creation with tomato and paprika puree or homemade
                        garlic mayonnaise.<br>
                        3. Paella ; is almost always associated with seafood, chicken and vegetables.<br>
                        The dish was named after the pan it is cooked in, a Paellera, which is also used for a variety
                        of
                        rice dishes, such as arroz negro, as well as the Spanish pasta dish: fideua.<br>
                        4. Spanish Churros with Chocolate ,Churros are sweet, deep-fried dough treats.<br>
                        Usually they are dipped in a hot, thick, pudding-like chocolate, hence the name – Churros Con
                        Chocolate.<br>
                        The popularity of these little guys is unbelievable.
